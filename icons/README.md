If we know details about a space, e.g. possible activities or available goodies, a descriptive icon should appear next to its entry. 

The alt text should make clear what we're trying to illustrate, maybe there's also a wiki page or similar that can be linked from each icon.

It'll be a bit tricky to make some things recognizable at small scale, but let's try!
